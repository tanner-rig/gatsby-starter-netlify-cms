  subtitle: Coach Jenny
  body: >-
    Coach Jenny grew up in Texas where she began swimming as a tadpole. She continued her swim career all the way through high school where she played water polo and was on the dive team for Sterling High School. She moved with her family to Kingwood Texas in 2012 and had her first experience with NWAL with the Forest Cove Frogs, where her children were swimmers. She began coaching at NEHA and then coached the Tidal Wave team for Blue Tide Aquatics in 2015, both year round USA competition teams.
    <br /><br />
    She has worked as a certified swim instructor teaching children and adults to swim at the YMCA in Kingwood. She also developed and started a program while there for home schooled swimming families, under the instruction of Kim Kelly and co coach Jan Preston. She was responsible for instruction groups of kids from beginners to advance, both stroke development and technique as well as water safety. Coach Jenny also taught private lessons in the community for both learn to swim and stroke improvement. Her credentials include USA swim, SI and CPR certified. She finds such joy in watching swimmers meet their own goals and expectations, while bringing excitement and fun to the kids.
    <br /><br />
    Coach Jenny has three fish of her own, Jacie - 15, Cole - 13, and Sadie - 9. They are all excited to be here in Utah to enjoy and adapt in their new community. She hopes her passion for the sport of swimming will show through to the swimmers and parents.
