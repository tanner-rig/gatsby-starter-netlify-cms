  subtitle: Coach Jenny
  body: >-
    Coach Jenny grew up in Texas where she began swimming as a tadpole. She continued her swim career all the way through high school where she played water polo and was on the dive team for Sterling High School. She moved with her family to Kingwood Texas in 2012 and had her first experience with NWAL with the Forest Cove Frogs, where her children were swimmers. She began coaching at NEHA and then coached the Tidal Wave team for Blue Tide Aquatics in 2015, both year round USA competition teams.
    <br /><br />
    She has worked as a certified swim instructor teaching children and adults to swim at the YMCA in Kingwood. She also developed and started a program while there for home schooled swimming families, under the instruction of Kim Kelly and co coach Jan Preston. She was responsible for instruction groups of kids from beginners to advance, both stroke development and technique as well as water safety. Coach Jenny also taught private lessons in the community for both learn to swim and stroke improvement. Her credentials include USA swim, SI and CPR certified. She finds such joy in watching swimmers meet their own goals and expectations, while bringing excitement and fun to the kids.
    <br /><br />
    Coach Jenny has three fish of her own, Jacie - 15, Cole - 13, and Sadie - 9. They are all excited to be here in Utah to enjoy and adapt in their new community. She hopes her passion for the sport of swimming will show through to the swimmers and parents.

      description: I couldn’t be happier with the progress my kids made with Coach Jenny. She met my kids where they were and taught them what they needed to know to be water safe. I had complete beginners work with her and kids who have some basics, but nothing more. She was able to work with each of them to start and to excel their swimming skills. I have one child who is tough to crack and Coach Jenny did! She made my kids feel comfortable in the water and to love it. It’s been a year since we took lessons from her and my kids still ask to swim with Coach Jenny. We couldn’t have asked for a better swimming experience.

      description: Jenny Morris was a very well respected swim coach when we joined the South Woodland Hills Wahoos in Kingwood Texas.  It was the first year that our children had been apart of a swim team and we were anxious if our child would stick with the program.  Our daughter immediately took to Jenny and her methods of teaching a younger child the basics of swimming.  After the first year of swim team, we then approached Jenny about private lessons to give our daughter a leg up on the next swim season.  We saw huge improvements with her strokes and confidence in the water. We would highly recommend Jenny Morris to anyone as a swim coach and personal swim lessons.
